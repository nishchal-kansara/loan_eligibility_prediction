# Loan Eligibility Prediction

The **"Loan Eligibility Prediction"** project aims to create a robust machine learning model that accurately predicts an applicant's eligibility for a loan based on various features such as income, credit history, and marital status. By utilizing a dataset that contains historical loan application data, the project employs data preprocessing techniques, exploratory data analysis, and classification algorithms - specifically, **Naive Bayes** and **Random Forest classifiers**. The goal is to develop a predictive model that helps financial institutions make informed lending decisions while minimizing the risks associated with loan defaults.

In conclusion, the **"Loan Eligibility Prediction"** project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in the financial sector by accurately assessing loan eligibility based on applicant data. Through careful data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation, the project highlights how advanced algorithms can provide actionable insights for lenders. The successful implementation of this model can lead to improved decision-making processes, ultimately enhancing the efficiency of loan approval systems and fostering better financial outcomes for both lenders and borrowers.
