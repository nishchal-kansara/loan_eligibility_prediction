# Loan Eligibility Prediction

The "Loan Eligibility Prediction" project aims to create a robust machine learning model that accurately predicts an applicant's eligibility for a loan based on various features such as income, credit history, and marital status. By utilizing a dataset that contains historical loan application data, the project employs data preprocessing techniques, exploratory data analysis, and classification algorithmsâ€”specifically, Naive Bayes and Random Forest classifiers. The goal is to develop a predictive model that helps financial institutions make informed lending decisions while minimizing the risks associated with loan defaults.<br><br>Dataset: [dataset.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wc1U7_fabihHKWlnXdxGixAcZtqA6lY3/view)<br><br>Check out my projects and resume:<br>Personal Website: [https://nishchal-kansara.web.app/](https://nishchal-kansara.web.app/)<br>Resume: [https://nishchal-kansara.web.app/resume.html](https://nishchal-kansara.web.app/resume.html)
